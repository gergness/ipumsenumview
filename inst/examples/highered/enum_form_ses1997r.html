<br/><em>INSTRUCTIONS
<p class="i1">Thank you for taking the time to complete this important questionnaire. Directions for filling it out are provided with each question. Because not all questions will apply to everyone, you may be asked to skip certain questions.</p></em>
<br/><b2>In order to get comparable data, we will be asking you to refer to the week of April 15, 1997 (i.e., April 13-April 19, 1997) when answering most questions.
<br/>Follow all "SKIP" instructions after marking a box. If no "SKIP" instruction is provided, you should continue to the next question.
<br/>Either a pen or pencil may be used.
<br/>When answering questions that require marking a box, please use an [X].
<br/>If you need to change an answer, please make sure that your old answer is either completely erased or clearly crossed out.
<br/>You may notice that some question numbers are not consecutive. This was done to maintain consistency with previous survey cycles. Please answer questions in the order they are printed except when following a "SKIP" instruction.</b2>
